      <h1>What is Taiwanese? </h1>

<h5>Podcast <a href="https://bitesizetaiwanese.com/about/" target="_blank" style="color:#42A5B6;">Bite-Size Taiwanese</a> gives a clear definition:</h5>

<p><b>Taiwanese refers to the language that is spoken by a large majority (roughly 70%) of the population on the island nation of Taiwan. </b></P>

<p>In the English-language media, Taiwanese often gets referred to as Hokkien or Southern Min. While these terms are often used interchangeably, they technically refer to different levels within a linguistic family tree.</P>

<p>Specifically, Taiwanese refers to a group of Hokkien variants that together with the history, society and environment of the island have mixed and evolved over centuries including influences from Japanese. Other variants of Hokkien found in Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Indonesia have also developed independently according to their histories and have absorbed vocabulary from neighboring languages.</P>

<p>Southern Min is a broader category that besides Hokkien includes Teochew and Hainanese. Southern Min, in turn, belongs to the broader grouping of Min, which is one of the big seven language groups of the Sinitic languages (the others being Mandarin, Yue, Hakka, Wu, Gan, Xiang). As a rough comparison, differences among these seven groupings are greater than those for the Romance languages. In fact, even just within the Min language group, speakers from languages of different branches may have a hard time understanding each other.</P>

<h1>Why we need to learn Taiwanese?</h1>

<h5>There are several reasons why we need to learn Taiwanese:</h5>

<ul>

<li><b>The inheritance of culture: </b>Taiwanese is not only an important language in Taiwan, but also preserves unique Taiwanese cultures. If the language disappeared, the culture and the identity that are integral with the language would also disappeared. </li> 

<li><b>Gain better career opportunity: </b>In 2018, Taiwanese government passed Development of National Languages Act. The law recognizes the multicultural nature of the nation, and it also promise to spur the development of national languages. Therefore, schools need more and more Taiwanese teachers. Besides, as for doctors or other jobs that need to talk to the elders, knowing how to speak Taiwanese can give you better opportunity to gain more clients.</li>

<li><b>Gain more social opportunity: </b>If you want to have more friends in Taiwan, and get along with the elders well, knowing Taiwanese can help you a lot. Even though for the youths who speak Chinese as their primary language, Taiwanese vocabulary is still an important part in their daily conversation.</li>
