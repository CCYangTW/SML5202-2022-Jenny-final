      <h1>Who are we?</h1>
      <p>We are Tâi-uân-uē, a group composed of university graduate school students. Experts pointed out that Taiwanese Hokkien is at risk of being endangered in thirty years. As a result, in 2019, Taiwan's legislative body passed the Development of National Languages Act, recognizing the country's multicultural identity and encouraging the development of national languages. However, discrimination against Taiwanese and a lack of instructors have made revitalizing the language difficult. Hence, we organized a society called Tâi-Uân-Uē (meaning Taiwanese in Taiwanese), designing a Taiwanese board game to improve children's daily Taiwanese conversation skills. Our goal is to help elementary school students learn and speak Taiwanese Hokkien in a funnier and easier way, and build awareness about the education of the native tongue in Taiwan. You may refer to the attached file for further information on our project. </p>
